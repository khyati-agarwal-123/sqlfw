###  Diversity and Inclusion {#GUID-9988A30D-7D01-426B-9735-17EC2F0B4A85} 

Oracle is fully committed to diversity and inclusion. Oracle respects and values having a diverse workforce that increases thought leadership and innovation. As part of our initiative to build a more inclusive culture that positively impacts our employees, customers, and partners, we are working to remove insensitive terms from our products and documentation. We are also mindful of the necessity to maintain compatibility with our customers' existing technologies and the need to ensure continuity of service as Oracle's offerings and industry standards evolve. Because of these technical constraints, our effort to remove insensitive terms is ongoing and will take time and external cooperation.

Many of the examples in this guide use the sample schemas of the seed PDB, which you can create when you install Oracle Database. See [ *Oracle Database Sample Schemas*  ](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlfw&id=COMSC) for information about how these schemas were created and how you can use them yourself.
