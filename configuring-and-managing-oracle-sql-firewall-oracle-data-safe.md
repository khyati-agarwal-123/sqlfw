##  Configuring and Managing Oracle SQL Firewall with Oracle Data Safe {#GUID-8A815EDA-73F9-4362-B379-0FA7094AEF8E} 

With Oracle Data Safe on Oracle Cloud, you can manage multiple SQL Firewalls centrally and get a comprehensive view of SQL Firewall violations across a fleet of Oracle databases. 

SQL Firewall administrators can use Data Safe to collect SQL activities of a database user with its associated database connection paths (IP address, OS program, OS user), and monitor the progress of the collection. Data Safe enables you generate and enable the SQL Firewall policy from the collected SQL traffic. Data Safe automatically collects the violation logs, and lets you monitor SQL Firewall violations from the console. 

The following image shows the SQL Firewall dashboard in Data Safe.

The violation summary in the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of SQL Firewall violations from all the targets in the compartment that have SQL Firewall enabled for the chosen period. From here, you can drill down into the violations for detailed analysis.
