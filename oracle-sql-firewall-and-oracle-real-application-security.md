##  Oracle SQL Firewall and Oracle Real Application Security {#GUID-3FFF1894-3C36-41A7-A565-F90B9581673E} 

You can use Oracle SQL Firewall with Oracle Real Application Security (Oracle RAS) to capture SQL statements that come from an Oracle RAS application for the ` XS$NULL ` user. 

You can generate and enforce an allow-list for the ` XS$NULL ` user after completing a SQL Firewall capture operation. However, SQL Firewall does not perform capture and enforce operations for Oracle RAS end-user identities.
